## Changelog


### 1.0.9-dev

* [LRM] The LRM for TRLC is [now written in
  TRLC](https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/trlc/tree/main/language-reference-manual). There
  is also a [HTML
  version](https://bmw-software-engineering.github.io/trlc/lrm.html)
  available for easier reading. During conversion we fixed a number of
  issues in the LRM (missing keywords, etc.) and made a few cleanups
  and simplifications; however the language and its semantics have not
  changed.

### 1.0.8

* [TRLC] Fix ICE when attempting to parse completely empty files.

* [LRM, TRLC] Two minor improvements for the handling of triple quoted
  strings: empty lines are now ignored when removing common leading
  whitespace, and trailing whitespace is stripped.

### 1.0.7

* [TRLC] Implement missing feature: integer values in record
  declarations can be prefixed by a unary `+` or `-`.

* [TRLC] Make parse order of files more predictable (which also makes
  error messages more predictable) and not so dependent on filesystem
  ordering.

### 1.0.6

* [LRM, TRLC] Support declarations of checks in the `.rsl` files. This
  means you don't need to have a separate check file, allowing you to
  implement your process or business logic closer to the type
  declarations. Dedicated check files continue to be supported.

* [LRM, TRLC] Rework builtin functions to not have the ugly `trlc:`
  prefix. Builtin functions now look more natural, e.g. `len` instead
  of `trlc:len`. The legacy functions will remain as a deprecated
  feature, and we'll remove them at a future date.

* [TRLC] Fix bug in array parsing and evaluation.

* [TRLC] Add the first two checks to the `--lint` option: one about
  misleading unary operators, and another on using deprecated
  functions.

* [TRLC] Fix a bug where a record reference to a type extension
  instead of the base type was not permitted, when it should be.

### 1.0.5

* [TRLC] Add `--brief` mode intended for CI. Expand tutorial to
  explain how it works.

* [TRLC] Add two new API functions (a [simpler
  lookup](https://bmw-software-engineering.github.io/trlc/manual/ast.html#trlc.ast.Symbol_Table.lookup_assuming)
  and [inheritence
  checking](https://bmw-software-engineering.github.io/trlc/manual/ast.html#trlc.ast.Record_Type.is_subclass_of)
  for record types).

### 1.0.4

* [LRM, TRLC] First public release
